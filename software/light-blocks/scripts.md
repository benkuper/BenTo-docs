# Scripts

Script light blocks enables to you to create custom effects by writing JavaScript code. You can create a new Script light block by clicking the green plus icon next to "Scripts" in the light blocks panel. Then you need to create a new text file in your filesystem. You then select the text file in the file path parameter. Now it's time to add some code to the file.

_Hint: You can find some_ [_example script files on the Github page_](https://github.com/benkuper/BenTo) _of the Bento project._
