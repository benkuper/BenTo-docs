# Introduction

On the next pages we are going to do a deep dive on Sequences. It is a powerful mechanism for building light shows timed to music. So let's get started!



Here are the chapters of the Sequence guide:

* [The Sequence Editor](../software/the-timeline.md)
* [Layer system + Blend Modes](layer-system-+-blend-modes.md)
* [Animating Parameters](animating-parameters.md)
* [Filtering](filtering.md) (by ID and Cluster Groups)
* [ID Mode](id-mode.md)
* [Streaming vs. Playback Mode](streaming-vs.-playback-mode.md)
* [Uploading a Sequence to Props](../software/baking-uploading-of-sequences.md)
